# Simple Quiz

This is a simple quiz generator.

No code compliation is necessary.  As long as index.html, quiz.js, quiz.css, and quizData.json are in the same folder, the page should be accessible.

## Development

You can test this locally, for example, by starting a python server in the same folder via `python -m http.server`.
